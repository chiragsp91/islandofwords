Almost everything in life has a backstory. Photographs are no exception to this. At first glance, they may appear to be static and frozen, but what makes them interesting is the fact that a set of events have led up to that one perfect shot. We may come across photographs that make us want to take a closer look. We become curious to know their back stories. They have meanings yet to be deciphered and stories waiting to be heard. Some photographs may appear to be simple and straightforward, but they end up capturing events which go on to become pivotal moments in history. Here are five such photographs with mind-blowing backstories.

### Photograph of Vladimir Lenin in a wheelchair taken in 1923, a year before his death

The one with the piercing stare in the photograph is none other than Vladimir Lenin. Beside him is his sister Anna Ilyinichna Yelizarova-Ulyanova and one of his doctors A. M. Kozhevnikov. His health had started to deteriorate from the numerous assassination attempts. This picture was taken in 1923 after Lenin had suffered 3 strokes over the previous two years. By this time, he was paralyzed and completely mute. The added stress of leading a revolution was also taking a toll on his life. He had become weak and frail. He had to give up his political activities, but he was still officially recognized as the leader of the Communist party. Ultimately, Vladimir died one year later, in 1924, when he was 53 years old.

When we visit new places for the first time, we all feel like leaving behind a memento of some kind. But astronaut Charlie Duke did things differently. He was part of the Apollo 16 crew. At age 36, he was the youngest astronaut to ever walk on the moon. During his time there, he left behind a family photograph on the moon! It was a signed photograph of Duke, his wife, and their children, covered in plastic wrap. He also left a message at the back of the photo which reads: 
"This is the family of astronaut Charlie Duke from planet Earth who landed on the moon on April 20, 1972."
This photograph was also taken by him while on the moon. The family photograph is still on the surface of the moon to this very day. The gesture of leaving behind something so special where only a handful of individuals have ever walked is incredible and heart-touching. Furthermore, it signifies the quality of ‘humanness’ even at the core of scientific explorations.

### Liquidators cleaning the radioactive debris in the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986

The photo shows civil and military personnel cleaning up the radioactive debris from the roof of reactor 3, in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986. They were known as liquidators or 'bio robots'. During the explosion of reactor No. 4, radioactive debris from the reactor’s core was thrown onto the roof of reactor No. 3. In order to carry out this extremely dangerous task, initially, remote-controlled robots were used, but they failed to do so due to the extreme level of radiation. As the last resort, humans were tasked with this deadly job. They had to wear protective gears made of sheets of lead. In spite of it, they could only remain in the contaminated area for less than a minute at a time before they exceeded the authorized level of radiation. If they remained for a longer period of time, it would have been detrimental to their health and their life expectancy would have lowered. The radiation even had an effect on the photograph. The white bands at the bottom of the photograph were the result of the high level of radiation emitted from below.

This is one of those photographs that immediately catches our attention. This spectacular photograph was taken in space. It is of the mannequin named 'Starman' wearing a spacesuit and drifting in space in a Tesla Roadster car. One can't beat this view of the Earth in the background! 'Starman' and the vehicle served as a dummy payload for the Falcon Heavy rocket’s maiden flight in February 2018. This spectacular photograph unlike anything seen before was taken in space by one of numerous cameras mounted on the car. As of October 2020, Starman was flying by the red planet, Mars! The center of the car’s dashboard displays the words ‘Don’t panic’. There was another secret message written in the circuit of the car which reads, ‘Made on Earth by human’, in case it ever encounters extraterrestrial life on its long journey!

In the photograph, you can see Apollo 11 astronauts, from left to right, Commander Neil Armstrong, Commander Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin Jr. They had to remain in the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF) after their return home journey from the moon in 1969. In the front, former President Richard M. Nixon is seen greeting and congratulating them on their successful mission. The astronauts were quarantined for 21 days after being exposed to the Lunar atmosphere. They had to be observed closely as they were the first astronauts to ever land on the moon. NASA wanted to make sure that no lunar contagions (if they existed) would make its way to Earth. The quarantine facility contained living and sleeping quarters, kitchen, and a bathroom. Interestingly enough, Neil Armstrong had to celebrate his 39th birthday in quarantine. He might as well have been one of the first individuals to do so many years back! (1,2)
